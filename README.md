### [Live Demo](https://github-4ys5ns.stackblitz.io/)

## Getting started

Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed globally. We use `npm` to manage the dependencies, so we strongly recommend you to use it. You can install it from [Here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install), then run `npm install` to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).

Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Building the project

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
